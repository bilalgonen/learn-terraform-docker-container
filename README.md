# Essential Functions for DevOps

- Work experience as a DevOps Engineer or similar software engineering role.
- Experience with automating testing and deployment pipelines using devops tools such as Jenkins, Azure DevOps.
- Build data pipelines: Managed data pipelines consist of a series of stages through which data flows (for example, from data sources or endpoints of acquisition to integration to consumption for specific use cases). These data pipelines must be created, maintained, and optimized as workloads move from development to production for specific use cases.
- Azure networking services (Virtual Network, VPN Gateway, Load Balancer, Private Link, Network Security Groups, Virtual Network Endpoints, Azure Monitor). (more info: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/category/networking).
- Azure security (Azure Key-Vault, Azure Active Directory, Azure Service Principal), More info: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/overview
